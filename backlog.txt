!! UX

- Daily win view is now overflowing in landscape or when there is too many lines
- When changed day overall result, but no win text, does not show overall result in daily win view

- Show the days that have wins marked with dots

- Double-check that all gesture detectors are wrapping containers and not inner elements
- See if wave animation when pressing next/prev buttons can be preserved by using stateless widgets
- The editor shows previous text very quickly before being updated with the new one
- Until has win, show countdown?

!! Performance and doing less with more:

!! Infrastructure

- "A splash screen was provided to Flutter, but this is deprecated."
