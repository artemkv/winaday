v1.0

- --Error screens v1--
- --UI state for no win registered--
- --Allow registering the day overall quality--
    - "No win yet"
    - "Got my win"
    - "Could not get my win"
    - "Awesome achievement"
- --Connect to db to actually load and save for real--
- --Maybe show sign-in/sign-out error somehow, now are hidden--
- --start writing win, should capitalize the first word--
- --autofocus win editor--
- --today needs to be somehow shown differently--
- --clicking on a day in the calendar stripe should navigate to that day--
- --Do not allow edit win for any date in the future--
- --Bigger padding when editing a win, to make it easier to edit--
- --Days in the future should be shown in grey, to indicate that you cannot edit them--
- --Limit the length of win editor text--
- --Cannot remove the win text, empty text fails validation--
- --Cache API responses--
- --Avoid loading the win immediately after saving, go directly to the daily win--
- --Do not request data for dates in the future, to avoid useless calls--
- --Arrows should move to prev/next week, not day--
- --Clicking on the month navigates to today--
- --Added links to Privacy Policy and Terms of Use--
- --When could not log in, allow go back to the welcome screen from error screen--
- --token_id is only valid for 1 hour and does not renew, forcing to reload the app, need to refresh token--
- --caching should be re-set on sign out. Now it is re-used across accounts--
- --On different devices and versions of Android the calendar stripe does not fit the screen--
- --Daily win view is now overflowing in landscape or when there is too many lines--

v1.1 Priorities

- Priorities
    - --Load priorities screen--
    - --Failed to load priorities screen--
    - --Edit priorities mode: re-order, delete, confirm, cancel--
    - --Edit priority: confirm saves, back cancels--
    - --Add new priority: confirm saves, back cancels--
    - --Max 9 priorities--
    - --Allow selecting colors--
    - --Use unique ids for priorities--
    - --Actually save priorities--
    - --Clicking back from editing priorities reloads priorities but does not leave the screen--
    - Limit box sizes for bigger screens?

- Use priorities
    - --Allow selecting on save of win--
    - --Only propose assigning priorities after editing win when no priorities are assigned yet, otherwise directly save the win--
    - --Only propose assigning priorities after editing win when there are active priorities to assign to--
    - --Allow changing when in win editor - rejected--
    - --Show in daily view, using colors or tags--
    - --Allow editing directly from day view--
    - --Mark/unmark--
    - --Old wins should still work--
    - --Showing priority in dailyWin view makes text center-aligned--
    - --Long priority does not fit in daily view screen--
    - --Save as a part of win (not saved now, issue with caching)--
    - --Cache loaded priorities--
    - --Deleted priorities should still show in the daily view, if linked--
    - --However, when editing priorities of a win, all deleted priorities should unlink automatically--
    - --Only show "link to priorities/edit" link if there are active priorities--
    - Do I really want to unlink from deleted priorities? Maybe that priority was still valid on that date. On the other hand, if I don't allow unlink it automatically, how would user be able to unlink, considering deleted priorities do not appear to un-toggle?

v1.2 Wins ListView

- --request using from-to for flexibility and control--
- --get the dates logic right--
- --navigate to day when clicked on list item--
- --when loading list view, should probably always start from today, not the currently selected day--
- --when loading a week returns nothing, it's completely unclear what happened, probably need to create empty items for missing days--
- --one week is very short, the load more trigger stays in the middle of the screen, so probably I need to load at least two weeks in advance--
- --consider making list item a widget, not a function, for performance reasons - tried and didn't notice any difference--
- --cache the results--
- --check how errors are handled--
- how do I go to today?
- Consider dropping older items from list and add the way to re-load them

v1.3 Calendar View

- Calendar View
    - --Show first 3 months--
    - --Show today--
    - --Show year separators--
    - --Load 3 months more when requested--
    - --When clicked on day, navigate to that day--
    - --Show days with wins using color--
    - --Cache the responses--
- --Click to reload should work on the whole area, not only the text--
- --Use @immutable where makes sense--
- --Show first word of priority inside the color box in the list view, so that you don't have to remember colors--
- --Moved the dailyWin view into a stateful widget to dispose of controller--
- --Infinite scroll for calendar and listview--
- Consider dropping older items from list and add the way to re-load them


TODO:

!! Features

!! UX

- When changed day overall result, but no win text, does not show overall result in daily win view
- Show the days that have wins marked with dots
- See if wave animation when pressing next/prev buttons can be preserved by using stateless widgets
- The editor shows previous text very quickly before being updated with the new one
- Until has win, show countdown?

!! Performance and doing less with more:

!! Infrastructure

- Use https://pub.dev/packages/visibility_detector to load next page for list instead of ...
- Use LayoutBuilder when need to measure the screen size
- "A splash screen was provided to Flutter, but this is deprecated."
- Look into font loading:
I/flutter (15668): Error: google_fonts was unable to load font YesevaOne-Regular because the following exception occured:
I/flutter (15668): Exception: Failed to load font with url: https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/a/326eec1af27e3634bbf470c04d8127d985571a07b5b79696eb6424489e27e106.ttf
- On some devices this error pops up:
D/libGLESv2( 8898): DTS_GLAPI : DTS is not allowed for Package : net.artemkv.winaday


!! Feedback

- Mark days that have wins with dot
- Show which month/year it is in the win list view
- Scrolling left/right does not work
