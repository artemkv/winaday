!! Features

- Add Privacy Policy and Terms of Use (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43583411/how-to-create-a-hyperlink-in-flutter-widget)

!! UX

- Need to be able to quickly navigate to today

!! Performance and doing less with more:

- Cache responses on all levels
- Do not request data for dates in the future, to avoid useless calls
- Consider avoiding loading the win immediately after saving, go directly to the daily win
- Rate limiter on backend

!! Infrastructure

- token_id is only valid for 1 hour and does not renew, forcing to reload the app, need to refresh token
